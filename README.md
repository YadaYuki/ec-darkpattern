<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Dark patterns in e-commerce: a dataset and its baseline evaluations </h1> 

This repository provides the text-based dataset and experimental code for the paper: [Dark patterns in e-commerce: a dataset and its baseline evaluations]()

## Overview

Dark patterns are user interface designs on online services that are designed to make users behave in ways they do not intend. In this research, we create a dataset that enables to construct machine learning models for text-based dark patterns automatic detection on online shopping sites. 

We also provided baseline evaluations of dark patterns automatic detection using classical NLP methods and transformer-based pre-trained language models (like BERT).
