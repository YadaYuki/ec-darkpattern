## Dark Patterns Automatic Detection using transformer-based pre-trained language models

Experimental code of text-based dark patterns automatic detection using transformer-based pre-trained language models.

### Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9.0
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) 1.2.1

### Setup

#### Installation

Install dependencies by running:

```
$ poetry install
```

#### Dataset preparation

Create Symlink to [dataset/]() directory by :

```
$ ln -s {path to dataset/} dataset
```

â€» Please place `dataset.tsv` directly under the `dataset/` directory.(`dataset/dataset.tsv`)

#### Set PYTHONPATH 

```
$ export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)"
```

### Train & Evaluate model

You can run experiment, 5-fold cross validation, using GPU(recommended) or CPU by running:

```
$ sh scripts/train.sh
```
